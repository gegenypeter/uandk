            uandksound has a strong sense of commitment with its acoustic and
            visual esthetics design. Naturally, their technical reliability and
            value are beyond our motto. Even the most innovative design is
            constantly improving so that uandksound builds progress into every
            product investing the effort to satisfy even the most discerning
            customer. That being so, we only offer the latest in audio
            technology for long term enjoyment. We do not produce cheap
            loudspeakers and certainly we do not offer a poor sound.
            Fortunately, many thousands of audiophiles worldwide agree with our
            philosophy. uandksound designs are easily integrated into your
            living room. Their full enjoyment should not require a complex
            installation. Either to watch a movie or listening to your favorite
            singer, uandksound brings to you an extensive catalog where young or
            elderly audio enthusiast can find the most suitable solution
            according to their preferences and possibilities without issue or
            compromise.

          <p>
            Loudspeaker as an integral part of the environment” A loudspeaker
            carries out the dual function of musical source and item of
            furniture in your home environment. uandksound design complies with
            conceptual style. It is the result of a continued integration
            between acoustic design and visual harmony. Just where the style and
            design imposed also define acoustic identity, or like a design
            element whose aesthetic value is judged by its coherence with its
            function. The loudspeaker cabinet is of such fundamental importance
            that we drew inspiration from the construction concepts of some well
            known stringed instruments. This is how uandksound loudspeakers
            achieve their pure, natural and definitive acoustic timbre.

          <h1>WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT</h1>
          <p>
            There are many companies manufacturing great loudspeakers, but
            uandksound is the sole company designing and manufacturing an
            innovative line of high-end cinema and custom loudspeakers among
            others. We don’t design our products as others, uandksound offers
            individual unique solutions to the problem of seamlessly integrating
            high-quality sound into the living environment. Uandksound products
            are virtually perfect for any application so that you should not
            complicate your mind to settle for another loudspeakers, that´s one
            reason for choosing uandksound, the best reference loudspeakers on
            the market will not make you happy unless the system is properly
            conceived, designed, installed, and explained. This is why
            uandksound works with the best worldwide distributors, some of them
            CEDIA members, offering exemplary factory support. You can be
            completely sure that the best experience will be grant for a long
            time after the sale. Only settle for the best ! uandksound is by far
            the best option to enjoy the most impressive sound for years without
            having to think about anything else to enjoy.

          <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
          <p>
            Investment in cutting-edge technology is our way to succeed. Before
            assembling the components are carefully selected and only those
            conforming to tightly defined tolerances are ultimately processed.
            The same care and attention is dedicated to the production of the
            crossover network, which along with the loudspeakers, is of
            fundamental importance to the quality of the diffusers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our extensive listening tests are a crucial part of the
            manufacturing process before each speaker and electronic are
            burned-in and thoroughly measured for several days. uandksound
            products advance to the final manufacturing step only if the
            measurements show no deviation. At the end, skilled, well trained
            ears test every component to ensure that everything is up to
            uandksound standards.
          </p>
          <h4>STYRENE RUBBER BOUNDARY</h4>
          <p>
            By using the latest styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) process to give
            you the best in reflex presentation and balance in all measurement
            without overload or malfunction. The width of the rubber edge is
            carefully designed to give flexible dimension. It would not pull the
            drive in rapid motion not under load in slower motion. This will
            also avoid transmitting the reversed phase of sound waves thus
            generating any acoustic wave interference. By using the double R
            analysis double ring, this will achieve it’s functionality without
            compromise.
          </p>

          <h4>CONE</h4>
          <p>
            The traditional low cone used today had already given a good sound
            quality, yet uandksound had designed methods and materials to give
            you even greater sound effect. We use significant materials to
            design the cone, thus achieving the best steel effect to produce
            greater efficiency. uandksound‘s middle unit took full advantage of
            welding the shell section to give you a greater penetrating and
            delicate sound.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coil">
          <h4>COIL TUBE</h4>
          <p>
            The three usual materials used, KSV, TIL and ASV, produce different
            sound effect, yet they all act to assist the control and balance of
            the speaker. Because uandksound wanted a unique sound quality, we
            adapt the combination of the coil tube and cone to give you the best
            possible design in demand.
          </p>
          <h4>WAVELENGTH</h4>
          <p>
            uandksound uses the best elasticated conex to form the master
            wavelength by combining the high heat formula process. This would
            give you the elasticity require, and by using the R and triangular
            designs in support, the movement of the speaker is not compromised.
          </p>
          <h4>SPEAKER SHELL</h4>
          <p>
            • We use ladder effect design for all our speakers, thus wide at the
            front and narrow at rear. This design will reduce sonic repercussion
            and diffraction. This will give the speaker more clearer and
            detailed sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Thinner wall layer not just give the speaker greater atmospheric
            compression, but also more dynamic driving force, and to give the
            speaker more transient effect at the same time.
          </p>
          <h4>CROSSOVER</h4>
          <p>
            • Using 12dB in design as well as implementing middle and high
            frequency impedance compensation process to balance the sound
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            • To give an accurate spread of all different areas in the speaker,
            and using the best quality component in tune to produce the best
            sound field.
